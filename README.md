About
This project recreates core Twitch functionality. The app supports channels, live video streams, live chat, channel creation, clips, and user profiles. It uses Next.js as the UI layer and API layer. Clerk handles auth. Supabase powers the database and storage. Stream Video handles media delivery and WebRTC. Stream Chat handles chat messages and channels. Tailwind styles the UI. TypeScript enforces types.

Architecture and data flow
The app consists of three main layers.

1) Client (Next.js)
- Renders UI.
- Holds Clerk client for auth.
- Uses Stream SDK for video and chat clients.
- Calls serverless API routes for protected operations.

2) Server (Next.js API routes + Supabase + Stream)
- Validates tokens from Clerk.
- Creates sessions and stream records in Supabase.
- Generates Stream tokens for video and chat.
- Triggers recordings via Stream Video API.
- Uses Supabase Postgres for relational data.

3) Third-party services
- Clerk provides user identity and session management.
- Supabase stores tables, files, and runs queries.
- Stream Video delivers live video and recordings.
- Stream Chat delivers chat messaging, moderation, and presence.

Sequence for a live stream start
1. Auth: streamer signs in via Clerk.
2. Create stream: client calls API route to create a stream record in Supabase.
3. Provision: server creates Stream Video session via Stream API and returns tokens.
4. Start stream: streamer client uses Stream Video SDK to publish media.
5. Viewers: use Stream Video player with viewer token to watch.
6. Chat: viewers open Stream Chat channel; messages go through Stream Chat and persist to Supabase via webhooks or a server worker.

- Add foreign key constraints for data integrity.

Example migration (SQL)
```
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  clerk_id text UNIQUE,
  display_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  bio text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE channels (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  slug text UNIQUE,
  title text,
  description text,
  thumbnail_url text,
  owner_id uuid REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_live boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

Stream Video & Chat setup
Register on Stream and enable Video and Chat products. Create an app to get API key and secret.

Server-side steps
1. Use STREAM_API_KEY and STREAM_API_SECRET to create Stream sessions.
2. Create session for publisher (streamer) with publish rights.
3. Create authenticated tokens for viewers with read-only rights.
4. Use Stream Video SDK on client to publish and play.

Example server code to create a Stream session (Node)
```
import Stream from 'stream';
const client = new Stream.StreamClient(STREAM_API_KEY, STREAM_API_SECRET);

async function createStreamSession(channelId, userId) {
  const response = await client.video.createSession({
    name: `channel-${channelId}`,
    type: 'stream',
    permission: 'publisher'
  });
  return response;
}
```

Stream Chat
- Create a chat channel per stream: channel type "livestream" or "messaging".
- Use Stream Chat SDK on client for chat UI.
- Persist messages to Supabase via webhook or server route.

Clerk setup
Create a Clerk application. Link to app domain (http://localhost:3000). Grab publishable and secret keys.

Integrate Clerk in Next.js
- Install Clerk SDK.
- Wrap app with ClerkProvider at root.
- Protect pages with requireAuth or use Clerk session.

Example integration
```
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
      navigate={(to) => router.push(to)}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

Deployment (Vercel & Supabase)
Vercel for frontend
- Connect GitHub repo to Vercel.
- Add project environment variables (same keys from .env).
- Set build command: pnpm build.
- Set output directory: .next or auto.

Supabase
- Use Supabase for DB and file storage.
- Run migrations on Supabase.
- Configure storage buckets for thumbnails and clips.

          version: 8
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm build
```

Performance and caching
- Use Next.js caching headers on SSR pages.
- Cache channel lists and thumbnails via CDN.
- Use incremental static regeneration (ISR) for less-changed pages.
- Use memory cache or Redis for ephemeral session data if needed.
- Stream Video and Chat handle real-time traffic and scale separately.

Security and auth flow
- Use Clerk for id tokens.
- Validate Clerk tokens on API routes.
- Use Supabase service role key only on server side.
- Revoke tokens on sign out.
- Protect stream publisher endpoints by checking user role and channel ownership.

API and routes overview
- /api/auth/validate â€” validate Clerk JWT and return user.
- /api/streams/create â€” create a stream record and create Stream Video session.
- /api/streams/start â€” mark stream as live and issue publisher token.
- /api/streams/stop â€” mark stream as ended and trigger recording save.
- /api/chat/token â€” create Stream Chat token for user.
- /api/upload/thumbnail â€” signed upload URL for Supabase Storage.
- /api/clips/create â€” create clip metadata and upload clip.

Code snippets: token creation (server)
```
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import Stream from 'stream';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);
  if (!userId) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });

  const streamClient = new Stream.StreamClient(process.env.STREAM_API_KEY, process.env.STREAM_API_SECRET);
  const session = await streamClient.video.createSession({
    name: `session-${userId}`,
    type: 'stream'
  });

  res.json({ session });
}
```

Common tasks
Create a channel
- Authenticated users can create channels.
- Use slug generation for friendly URLs.
- Upload a thumbnail to Supabase Storage.

Start a stream
- Streamer calls /api/streams/create to allocate Stream session and stream key.
- Streamer uses Stream Video SDK to publish.

Moderate chat
- Use Stream Chat moderation tools to ban, timeout, and flag messages.
- Keep a mod panel to review flagged content.

Save a clip
- Use server-side API to request a clip from Stream Video or trim a recorded file.
- Store clip in Supabase Storage and save metadata in clips table.

Background jobs
- Use serverless functions or a worker pool for heavy tasks like transcoding.
- Use Stream's recording APIs to get final video URLs and then save them.

Troubleshooting FAQ
Q: I get "Unauthorized" on API route.
A: Check CLERK secret key on server. Ensure token from front end is valid and passed in Authorization header.

Q: Video fails to publish.
A: Check browser permissions for camera and microphone. Ensure TURN/STUN servers are reachable for WebRTC. Confirm Stream session tokens are valid.

Q: Chat messages do not appear for viewers.
A: Verify Stream Chat channel creation and that viewer token allows read. Check moderators and permissions.

Q: Supabase storage upload fails.
A: Confirm bucket name and policy. Check NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and anon key on client. For server uploads, use the service role key.

Q: How to replay recorded streams?
A: After the stream ends, request the recording from Stream Video. Save the recording URL and serve it via a player component.

Developer notes and design patterns
State management
- Use React Query or SWR for server data.
- Use local state for UI-only state.
- Keep chat state in Stream Chat client; persist minimal data to DB.

Serverless design
- Use API routes for token issuance and server-guarded operations.
- Keep heavy workloads off serverless functions.

Webhooks
- Use Stream webhooks to notify your app on recording completion.
- Use Supabase functions or serverless endpoints to process webhook events and store final URLs.

Scaling tips
- Use CDN for static assets and recorded video.
- Use separate projects for dev and production in Stream and Supabase.
- Use rate limits for chat to prevent abuse.

Key code pointers
- Protect server routes with Clerk server SDK.
- Use Stream SDKs with server secret on server and with viewer tokens on client.
- Use Streaming and Chat tokens per user per session.

Sample component outline
Channel layout component (pseudo)
```
<ChannelLayout>
  <VideoPlayer session={session} />
  <ChatPanel channelId={channelId} />
  <ChannelInfo />
</ChannelLayout>
```
